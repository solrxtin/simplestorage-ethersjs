This is a simple project that shows how to use solidity basic data types
To compile the contract you can simply run yarn compile, which runs the script in the package.json. Endeavour to change the file name, if running a different solidity script other than the one in this directory.
The project is deployed using ethers.js. To deploy your contract run `node deploy.js`
